# Introduction

In [@nunery2010], different management regimens were modeled to explore
their impact on carbon storage. This study used the Forest Vegetation
Simulator (FVS) to model carbon storage. Other models exist to predict
carbon storage; we seek to compare FVS with other models to understand
their different predictions for carbon storage under different
management regimens.
