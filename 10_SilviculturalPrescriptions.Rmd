# Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2) # melt()
library(RSQLite)
library(measurements) # conv_unit and conv_multiunit
library(maps)
library(pbapply) # Progress bar for long operations
options(scipen = 9) # Use integer notation for numbers under 9 digits
```

```{r source-functions}
source('R/functions.R')
```

## Use Cache

Some datasets take a long time to compute; these are normally cached and
read from cache. Set `USE_CACHE` to `FALSE` to re-compute everything, and
`TRUE` to use cached values if available.

```{r USE_CACHE}
USE_CACHE <- TRUE
```

## Species Crosswalk

Different systems use different ways of encoding species. Here's a single
crosswalk for them all.

```{r species_mixin}
species_mixin <- read_rds("data/intermediate/species_mixin.rds")
```

# Harvested Plots in the Northeast

Find all FIA plots that:

* are in the northeastern region, and
* use the modern plot design, and
* have at least 10 years of measurements, and
* are fully forested, and
* is not disturbed ("disturbed" is separate from harvest), and
* is harvested, and
* is not seeded, fertilized, herbicided, etc. post-harvest, and
* is measured both pre- and post-harvest, and
* have a single condition for the entire plot

# Harvested Trees

Find the trees that were removed during harvest.

Note that FIA.TREE.STATUSCD == 3 indicates that a tree has been harvested,
but not all harvested trees have STATUSCD == 3. Therefore we approximate
harvested trees by finding all trees that exist in a pre-harvest inventory,
but do not exist (or are marked as harvested) in the corresponding harvest
inventory.

## TODO List

✔️ Convert harvest years to per-plot harvest numbers
✔ join harvest number on to tree
✔ data validation: were all trees harvested in a harvest?
  ✔ there are about 20 standing dead trees that are subsequently harvested;
    given that there are so few, I'm going to not worry about them
    and treat them the same as live trees that are harvested
✔ data validation: were trees removed from harvested plots?
  ✔ there are 13 plots that FIA marks as "harvested," were there are no
    trees on the plot pre-harvest that are not on the plot post-harvest.
    Given that there are only 13 of these, I am removing these plots from
    the analysis.
→ create a dataframe with tree_cn and prescription
* write out the prescription table

## Trees removed in harvest

Fetch trees that were live pre-harvest, that are neither live nor dead
post-harvest.

## FIA Harvested Trees

Fetch trees that FIA says were harvested.

```{r tree_fia_harvested}
rds_file <- "data/intermediate/tree_fia_harvested.rds"
if (USE_CACHE & file.exists(rds_file)) {
  tree_fia_harvested <- read_rds(rds_file)
} else {
  fia <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 'data/raw/SQLite_FIADB_ENTIRE.db')
  
  plot_mixin <- tbl(fia, 'PLOT') |>
    select(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, INVYR, MEASYEAR)
    
  tree_fia_harvested <- tbl(fia, 'TREE') |>
    semi_join(
      stand_stats |> filter(HARVEST == 1),
      by = join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, INVYR),
      copy = TRUE
    ) |>
    select(CN, STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, SUBP, TREE, INVYR, STATUSCD) |>
    filter(STATUSCD == 3) |>
    left_join(plot_mixin, by = join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, INVYR)) |>
    collect()
  
  DBI::dbDisconnect(fia)
  
  remove(fia, plot_mixin)
  
  write_rds(tree_fia_harvested, rds_file)
}
```

## Validation

Were all the trees that FIA says were harvested actually removed?
```{r tree_harvested_but_not_removed}
tree_harvested_but_not_removed <- tree_fia_harvested |>
  anti_join(tree_removed_in_harvest, by = join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, SUBP, TREE))
stopifnot(tree_harvested_but_not_removed |> nrow() == 0)
```

It is expected that FIA did not mark all removed trees as harvested.
```{r tree_removed_but_not_harvested}
tree_removed_but_not_harvested <- tree_removed_in_harvest |>
  anti_join(tree_fia_harvested, by = join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, SUBP, TREE))
tree_removed_but_not_harvested |> nrow()
```

All harvested trees should be on harvested plots.
```{r stopifnot_tree_removed_from_non_harvested_plots}
stopifnot(
  tree_removed_in_harvest |>
    distinct(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, INVNUM) |>
    # INVNUM is the last inventory in which the tree was standing,
    # so it is marked harvested in the next inventory
    mutate(INVNUM = INVNUM + 1) |>
    anti_join(
      stand_stats |> filter(HARVEST == 1),
      by = join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT, INVNUM)
    ) |>
    nrow() == 0
)
```

There are some plots that do not have trees removed.
```{r plot_harvested_without_tree_removed}
plot_harvested_without_tree_removed <- plot_harvested |>
  anti_join(
    tree_removed_in_harvest |>
      distinct(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT),
    join_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT)
  )
plot_harvested_without_tree_removed |> nrow()
```

## Remove Harvested Plots Without Removed Trees

Remove those plots from consideration.
```{r ignore plots with no trees removed}
join_cols <- plot_harvested_without_tree_removed |>
  names()
plot_harvested <- plot_harvested |>
  anti_join(plot_harvested_without_tree_removed, join_cols)
stand_stats <- stand_stats |>
  anti_join(plot_harvested_without_tree_removed, join_cols)
rm(join_cols)
```

What's left?
```{r map_by_ecoregion2}
map_data('state', fvsne_states$region) |> 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") + 
  geom_point(
    data = stand_stats |>
      group_by(STATECD, COUNTYCD, PLOT) |>
      filter(row_number() == 1),
    aes(color = ECOCD)
  ) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Ecoregion")
```
# Run FVS
When running FVS, we will need:

* CutList / CutLiDB - list of trees harvested
* TreeList / TreeLiDB - list of trees; probably we want cycle 0 captured
* ATrtList / ATrtLiDB - After treatment (post treelist, pre harvest) tree list


Example of how to write to a database table:
```{r}
harvest_prescriptions <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 'data/fvs/harvest_prescriptions.db')
DBI::dbWriteTable(harvest_prescriptions, 'PRSC', tree_harvested)
DBI::dbDisconnect(harvest_prescriptions)
```
